Once you've got the rules down, your assignment should be fairly straightforward. 
You'll want to draw the board, and allow two players to take turns placing their pieces on the board 
(but as you learned above, they can only do so by choosing a column, not a row). 
The first player to get 4 across or diagonal should win!

Extra Credit:

Want to try colorful pieces instead of X and O? 
First you'll need to figure out how to import a package like termcolor into your project. 
We're going to cover importing later in the course, 
but try and see if you can figure it out on your own. 
Or you might be able to find unicode characters to use instead, 
depending on what your system supports. Here's a hint: print(u'\u2B24')
